            <h2 style="font-family: fantasy;">The Effect Of Art On Stress</h2>
            <p class="custom-paragraph" style="font-size: 18px;"> Life's demands often leave us feeling overwhelmed and stressed. In such times, a simple and accessible remedy lies at our fingertips – drawing. This creative outlet has a remarkable ability to dissolve stress and bring solace. As pencil meets paper, worries fade into the background. The act of drawing engages the mind, leading it away from troubles and into the realm of creativity. This immersion in the present moment acts as a powerful distraction, promoting mindfulness and relaxation. Beyond distraction, drawing provides an avenue for emotional expression. Lines and colors become the language of emotions, allowing us to communicate without words. With each stroke, the mind unburdens itself, leaving a sense of lightness and calm. Drawing's therapeutic effects stem from its ability to induce the flow state, where time loses meaning and stress loses grip. The process triggers a release of dopamine, fostering feelings of pleasure and accomplishment. Artistic skill isn't a prerequisite; everyone can partake and benefit. In the end, drawing serves as a personal sanctuary, a space where stress takes a backseat, and creativity reigns. So, when stress knocks, pick up a pencil, sketch your thoughts, and watch as tranquility unfolds.</p>

                <p class="custom-paragraph" style="font-size: 18px;">Oil painting has a rich history that began in the Northern Renaissance of the 15th century. It gained popularity due to its vibrant colors, slow drying time allowing for blending, and greater detail. It eventually spread to Italy, influencing the Venetian school. During the Baroque era, artists like Caravaggio and Rembrandt used oil techniques for dramatic effects. The 19th century saw portability with paint tubes, leading to plein air painting. Oil painting continues to evolve, remaining a prominent artistic medium today.</p>
